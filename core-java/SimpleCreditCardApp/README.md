#Simple Credit Card Application
This project utilises the use of the Framework (DesignPatternsProject) project that I had created. This was a masters project which required to create a framework for a Banking Applications. It was to utilise as much design patterns as possible. 

Assumptions:
===========================================================================================
 * This project does not include any real persistance as the objective is to only experiment on design patterns.
 * A UML is provided to explain the framework and show the design patterns used.
 * It tries to simulate a persistance through saving on "database.txt" file, thus the executable output needs to have the file present on the same location.
 
Notes to consider: 
===========================================================================================
 * The output of this project should be a JAR file that the would show a simple GUI (Swing).
 * Used IntelliJ to build artifact/jar
 * project structure of the libs is not correct.
